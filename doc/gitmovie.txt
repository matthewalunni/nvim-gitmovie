GitMovie - Neovim plugin to replay git commits as animated diffs

Commands
  - GitMovieStart [repo_path] : Start replay from the given repo or current CWD
  - GitMovieStop            : Stop the animation and close the viewer
  - GitMovieSetRepo <path>  : Set the repository path
  - GitMovieSpeed [ms]       : Set speed (milliseconds per frame)

Usage
  1) Set a repo: `:GitMovieSetRepo /path/to/repo` or rely on current working directory
  2) Start replay: `:GitMovieStart /path/to/repo` (or omit to use the set repo)
  3) Control: `:GitMovieSpeed 80` to speed up; `:GitMovieStop` to end

Notes
  - The plugin renders a floating window containing the animated diff for each commit, line-by-line.
  - Diff lines are colored: additions in green, deletions in red, context in gray.
